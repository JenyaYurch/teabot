# Tea Suggester Telegram Bot â€” Requirements Document

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1. Catalog Parsing
- The system must automatically parse the tea catalog from [https://www.teashop.by/](https://www.teashop.by/).
- The parser must extract tea categories, subcategories, product names, descriptions, prices, and available packaging options.
- The parser must update the local database with new teas and changes in the catalog on a regular schedule (e.g., daily or weekly).

### 1.2. Database Management
- The system must store parsed tea data in a PostgreSQL database on the local machine.
- The database must support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tea products and categories.
- The database must store user profiles, including preferences, history, and feedback.
- The database must be structured and indexed to support efficient queries for LLM (Large Language Model) usage, such as semantic search, context retrieval, and recommendation generation.

### 1.3. Telegram Bot Integration
- The system must provide a Telegram bot interface for users.
- The bot must allow users to:
  - Start a conversation and register a profile.
  - Set and update their tea preferences (e.g., type, strength, flavor, price range).
  - Receive personalized tea suggestions based on their preferences and history.
  - Search for teas by name, category, or characteristics.
  - View detailed information about suggested teas.
  - Provide feedback on suggestions to improve future recommendations.

### 1.4. Recommendation Engine
- The system must analyze user preferences and history to suggest teas.
- The recommendation logic must improve over time based on user feedback and interactions.
